Generic Crypto Utils is technical addon developed by the `Center of Research &
Development company <https://crnd.pro/>`__. 

The goal of this addon is to provide generic utilities to add encryption to other addons.
Currently it implements ``generic.crypto.param`` model, wich works same
as ``ir.config_parameter`` but values stored are encrypted.

It is required to place *encryption key* in odoo configuration file (``odoo.conf``).
To do this, add following line to config file: ``crypto_token = <key>``

Run following command to generate new key:
``python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key())"``
